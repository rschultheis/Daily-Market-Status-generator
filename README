DailyDose will provide a tumblr blog, updated daily after mkt close at a designated time (4:30 / 5)?

It should look cool

The purpose is to provide a historical, contextual layer to the daily market recap type blog.  Numbers based, and just a few simple numbers that you wont find in too many places, like 200 DMA.

Unsure of legal reprecussions of doing this, should be fine?

For indexes S&P 500, DJI, NASDAQ Composite it should provide:
- close / volume
- 200 / 60 / 20 Day Moving Average (DMA)
- % above / below the above moving averages
- 200 / 60 / 20 Day Volume Average
- % above / below the above moving averages
- Chart summarizing above stats
- some basic commentary taking into context the year behind.


To pull it off:
- (/) seed csv from yahoo (easy).

- can use rake to execute a "build", which essentially will construct the blog

- (/) procedure which updates the seed csv to latest closing (yahoo-finance)
module DataUpdater

- procedure which enhances daily values with relevant stats: 
module AnalysisUpdater
-- moving averages, volume averages
-- saves back to original or new csv?

- (/) all data csv based so can always be pulled into a spreadsheet (faster-csv, csv-mapper)
module CsvIO

- procedure which constructs html from new data calcs (erb / activewhatever that is?)
module HtmlBuiler

- procedure which posts html to tumblr (rest api should be easy).  should keep track of last uploaded date and only upload if today's upload payload > than last.
module BlogPoster
